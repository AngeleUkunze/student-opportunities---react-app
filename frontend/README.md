Student Opportunities React App

A simple React app where students can explore opportunities like Internships, Scholarships, and Jobs.

You can:

Sign up and log in

Add new opportunities with a title and type

Mark opportunities as Applied (green) or Interested (orange)

Delete opportunities if needed

Currently, the app doesn’t save data to a database. Everything you do is temporary and resets on page reload. The backend exists and is running, so data saving can be added later.

Extras:

Notifications tell you if you try to act without logging in

Clean, simple, responsive design

All features are easy to use and visually clear

Future improvements:

Connect frontend to backend for real data persistence

Save applied/interested status per user

Real authentication with secure login
